# University of Helsinki course FYS2029 Quantum Computing project work: Quantum machine learning

Quantum machine learning is the application of quantum computing to solve machine learning problems.
This project investigates the use of quantum neural networks for the classification of the MNIST dataset.
The project consists of a Jupyter notebook and supporting Python libraries.
Please see the
[Jupyter notebook](main.ipynb)
for a proper introduction.

This project is heavily based on the
[TensorFlow Quantum tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/overview),
and is therefore distributed with the
