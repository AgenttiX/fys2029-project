# University of Helsinki course FYS2029 Quantum Computing project work: Quantum machine learning



Due to various other exams and project works the available time was limited to a few days,
and therefore these are merely simple examples instead of a full-scale application.

This project is heavily based on the
[TensorFlow Quantum tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/overview),
and is therefore distributed with the
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
that they use.
